# Graph Analysis

This [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) repository, developed during the course of [**IN490** _Programming Languages_ - A.A.2019/19](http://dmf.matfis.uniroma3.it/matematica/laurea/scheda_corso.php?id=1103), is a new tool think to be used in graph analysis to study connection over colored graphs.

## Main Aims
 - develope a simple direct/undirect colored and weighted graph structure `G`.
 - build a tool to obtain line graphs `L(G)`.
 - build a tool to reduce a graph by an edge `e`.
 - build a tool that reduce a non-properly-colored graph in a colored graph.

## Dependencies
Currently the only dipendece is [PetGraph](https://github.com/bluss/petgraph) `v0.4.13`.

## Structure of the Repository

 - docs: Contains all the documents related to this package.
 - src: Source folder of the `.rs` files.
